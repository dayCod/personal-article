Laravel has always been known for making complex web development tasks feel simple and elegant. But when it comes to concurrency—handling multiple operations at the same time—developers often find themselves scratching their heads. From database locks to race conditions, concurrency can make or break your app’s reliability.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into Laravel's concurrency handling techniques. We’ll explore traditional methods and unlock the new features introduced in Laravel 12, including the powerful Concurrency::class facade. Whether you're building startup MVPs or enterprise systems, mastering concurrency is your next big step.

## Understanding Concurrency in Laravel

### Why Concurrency Matters ?

Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks that run at the same time. In web apps, this could mean handling user requests, background jobs, or processing large datasets without causing data corruption or performance hits.

Laravel provides several out-of-the-box tools to help manage concurrency, from database locks to queues and cache-based synchronization.

## Traditional Concurrency Handling

### 1. Database Locks

Using database-level locks is a common strategy. Laravel’s DB::transaction() and select for update queries can prevent race conditions.

```php
DB::transaction(function () use ($userId) {
    $user = User::where('id', $userId)->lockForUpdate()->first();
    $user->credits -= 10;
    $user->save();
});
```

This ensures no two processes update the same row at the same time.

### 2. Cache Locks

Laravel supports atomic locks using caches like Redis or Memcached. This is lighter than database locks and perfect for short critical sections.

```php
Cache::lock('process:123', 10)->block(5, function () {
    // Do critical work
});
```

## New in Laravel 12: Concurrency Facade

### Introducing `Concurrency::class`

Laravel 12 introduces a powerful `Concurrency` facade that simplifies running multiple operations concurrently in PHP. Whether you want to execute tasks in parallel or handle classic locks, this facade brings a unified and expressive API.

#### Running Concurrent Tasks

You can execute multiple closures concurrently using the `run` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Concurrency;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

[$userCount, $orderCount] = Concurrency::run([
    fn () => DB::table('users')->count(),
    fn () => DB::table('orders')->count(),
]);
```

Laravel will automatically execute these tasks in parallel using child PHP processes, improving performance on multi-core systems.

#### Using Specific Drivers

You can choose different drivers, such as `fork`, for running your concurrent tasks:

```php
$results = Concurrency::driver('fork')->run([
    // Your concurrent closures
]);
```

#### Deferring Tasks

If you prefer to execute tasks after the HTTP response has been sent (without waiting for results), use the `defer` method:

```php
use App\Services\Metrics;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Concurrency;

Concurrency::defer([
    fn () => Metrics::report('users'),
    fn () => Metrics::report('orders'),
]);
```

Laravel will handle these tasks in the background, making it ideal for logging, reporting, or analytics that shouldn't delay user responses.

## Best Practices for Laravel Concurrency

### 1. Prefer Cache Locks Over DB Locks

For most cases, cache locks (especially with Redis) are faster and scalable. Use DB locks only when necessary.

### 2. Embrace Laravel 12’s Concurrency Facade

Standardize your locking logic and concurrent tasks using the new Concurrency::class. It improves code readability and maintainability.

### 3. Avoid Long Locks

Keep your critical sections short to avoid deadlocks and performance bottlenecks.

### 4. Use Queues for Heavy Tasks

Offload time-consuming processes to Laravel queues. Workers can run tasks asynchronously, reducing lock contention.

## Conclusion

Laravel’s magic doesn’t stop at beautiful syntax—it extends deep into safe and scalable concurrency handling. By mastering database locks, cache locks, and now the Laravel 12 `Concurrency::class` facade, you can build apps that are not just elegant but also rock-solid under pressure.

So next time you tackle concurrency, remember: Laravel's got your back—and now, so do you.
